The goal of this project is a one-for-one "perfect port" of the C&C Generals and ZH source code to web. Avoid mocks, stubs, or temporary patches when possible.
The full, original C&C Generals source code is accessible in-repo.
When making game architecture decisions, examine the source first.
Keep building until the job is done. Don't halt for user input unless absolutely necessary.
